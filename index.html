<p>Round, Rectangular, or Other: You are no longer limited to traditional round door knobs - oh no! Now, you can shop a wide selection of designer handles. Now days, you can choose long, slender rectangular door pulls or you can choose those wide, broad industrial looking door pulls or, yes, you can even still choose a traditional round door knob if you so desire but, place it in the center of your door hobbit-style. You can even choose curved, rather elegant gate pulls for your doors. It is all up to you!</p>
<p>If different shapes to choose from is not enough to show your true taste, you also have a choice of materials for your door handles - designer handles are available in stainless steel and bronze! If you want something more rustic and subtle, you might opt for bronze pull handles on your doors. If, on the other hand, you would rather have your home really stand out from the crowd, you might prefer stainless steel door handles that shine brightly and glisten in the sun. Again, it is all up to you!</p>
<p>And, as if all of those choices are not enough, both bronze handles and stainless steel door handles are available in a number of finishes for you to choose from. Both varieties are available in matte or gloss finishes. Stainless steel can be finished in a range of colors - white, black, gunmetal gray, and more. Bronze can be finished with varying levels of the golden coppery shade that bronze is known for. Both can be tooled so that they have wonderful texturing. Again, the choice is yours and, you might be pleasantly surprised at the variety of designer handles you have to choose from when you look.</p>
<p>Aesthetics aside, bronze door handles and stainless steel pull handles are remarkably strong and easy to care for. Because bronze and stainless steel are both alloys, they are incredibly strong - that means that they are hard to dent, ding, or scratch, no matter what you do to them. It also means that a soft dry cloth is the only equipment required to keep your designer handles nicely polished and glistening.</p>
